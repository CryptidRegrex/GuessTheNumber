This program generates random numbers, which cannot repeat, in an array using MIPS assembly code.
It then generates a value that it will search for inside the array if it finds it, then it will display the location of the value in the array.
If the value does not exist in the array it will return "-1".

Run on the command prompt using the MARS assembler using "java -jar [MARS.jar] prj1.asm"
